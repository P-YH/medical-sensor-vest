Tested using Raspberry Pi 3 Model B V1.2 with 2020-05-27-raspios-buster-full-armhf image on a 32GB SD card.

Seems to work better with Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 4GB RAM with Raspbian. (I don't know the version, it came with a kit but I updated it.) The USB-Serial polling rate is about 3.5x faster with the Raspberry 4.

Interfaced with Adafruit's ItsyBitsy M0 Express 48MHz using a virtual serial port over USB.
