Tested with Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 4GB RAM with Raspbian. (I don't know the version, it came with a kit but I updated it.) The USB-Serial polling rate is about 3.5x faster with the Raspberry 4. Samples each sensor at about 1000Hz when using two bands.

Interfaced with Adafruit's ItsyBitsy M0 Express 48MHz using a virtual serial port over USB.
